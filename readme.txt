Marks AI-generated and AI-modified media as the EU AI Act asks – in the media library, with the EU's official icons on your site.

== Description ==

Since 2 August 2026, Article 50 of the EU AI Act asks businesses to label images, videos and recordings that look real but were made or changed with AI. AI Act Image Labels puts that decision where your media lives.

* A decision per file in the media library: AI-generated, modified with AI or no label needed – in the details, as bulk actions, with a filter and a column.
* The European Commission's official icons (AI GENERATED, AI MODIFIED, AI) in a corner of the image, with the notice for screen readers and on hover – never in the alt text.
* Works by itself for featured images, blocks, galleries, covers, video and audio; finds images in HTML blocks and page builders by their file; functions for themes.
* Reads traces of AI in your files on your server: C2PA Content Credentials, IPTC digital source type, Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI data, file names of AI tools.
* Shows where each file is used and opens those pages to check the label really appears.
* "Analyze image (AI)": the AI looks at the picture, its traces and the pages it is on, and says whether a label is required – using the AI provider set up under Settings › Connectors (WordPress 7.0+). Everything else works without AI.
* Configurable icon, colour, transparency, size, corner and words.

The tool is under Media › AI labels. This plugin helps with labelling; it is not legal advice.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin from Plugins › Add New, or upload the zip under Plugins › Add New › Upload Plugin.
2. Activate it. The tool opens under Media › AI labels.
3. Click "Check site": the plugin reads where your media is used and looks for traces of AI in the files.
4. Decide per file in the Review tab or in the media library. Labelled media show the icon on the site right away.
5. Optional: for "Analyze image (AI)", set up an AI provider under Settings › Connectors (WordPress 7.0 or later).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to label every AI image? =

No. Article 50 asks for a label on content that looks real and could be taken as real – deepfakes: photorealistic people, products, places or events. Obviously artificial images (illustrations, comics, abstract backgrounds) and ordinary editing (crop, colour, light, noise, upscaling) need no label. The Knowledge tab explains the rules with sources.

= Does the plugin find AI images by itself? =

It reads traces that many AI tools write into the file: C2PA Content Credentials, the IPTC value "trainedAlgorithmicMedia", Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI data, and the file names of AI tools. A missing trace proves nothing – screenshots, exports and image optimizers remove them. You decide; the plugin suggests.

= Where does the label appear? =

As the EU icon in a corner of the image or video, with the notice for screen readers and on hover, and behind captions that are shown anyway. Never in the alt text. Featured images, blocks, galleries, covers, video and audio get it by themselves. A theme that prints images itself can call ai_act_labels_wrap().

= Do I need an AI provider? =

No. Labelling, the check, the traces in files and the icons work without one. Only "Analyze image (AI)" needs a provider set up under Settings › Connectors (WordPress 7.0 or later).

= Can I use my own icon? =

Yes: the EU icon by kind, the round EU icon, the round icon that opens on hover, your own image or a sparkle – dark, light, picked by image or in a colour of your own, 0 to 75 % transparent, in three sizes and four corners.

= Is the EU icon free to use? =

Yes. The European Commission published the icons in June 2026 for free use, without attribution. The plugin ships them unchanged.

== Screenshots ==

1. Review: what carries traces of AI and what is used on the site without a decision – decide per file, or let the AI analyze the image.
2. Appearance: icon, colour, size, corner and words, with a live preview on one of your images.
3. Knowledge: the rules of Article 50 in plain words, with sources.
4. The decision in the media library's details, with the traces found in the file and the image analysis.
5. A labelled image on the site, with the notice on hover.

== External services ==

Three features make requests to other servers:

= "Analyze image (AI)" (optional) =

When you click "Analyze image (AI)", the plugin sends the image, its file name, title, the traces found, where it is used (page titles) and its current decision to the AI provider you set up under Settings › Connectors. WordPress' AI Client makes the request; which service receives it, and its terms and privacy policy, depend on the provider you chose there. Nothing is sent until you click it.

= "Check on the site" =

This check opens the pages of your own site where a file is used (at most six per file) to see whether the label appears. The requests go only to your own site's address.

= The card from engenty =

At the end of the tool, a card from engenty – the maker of this plugin – shows what engenty offers. Its words come from https://engenty.ai/wordpress-plugins/ai-act-image-labels/promo.json: the plugin fetches this file at most once a day, when someone opens the tool. The request is the same for every site and sends nothing about yours – no address, no user, no statistics; engenty.ai's server sees the request like any visit. The file holds only text and a link, which the plugin prints as text. If the file cannot be fetched, no card appears. Privacy policy: https://engenty.ai/privacy
